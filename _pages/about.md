I am a 4th year PhD student at MIT, studying experimental nuclear physics. When not fighting with computing clusters or performing percussive maintenance, I'm usually in the [mountains](/outdoors) or on the [water](/outdoors).  


## [Current Research](/research/LAD)

I'm currently working under Or Hen, studying nuclear structure and the EMC Effect. This work required a year of data taking at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, where (as the only graduate student on the experiment), I performed tasks ranging from detector and readout electronics installation; data aquisition setup (triggers, FADC's, TDC's, etc.), raw signal processing, and higher level physics analysis. Having succesfully collected all data in July 2025, I'm currently working with a team of post-docs, research scientists, and professors to calibrate, analyze, and publish our data by 2027.
